# Absence Streak Detection and Notification System

## Overview

This project processes student attendance data to identify streaks of absences and sends automated email notifications to the parents of students who have been absent for consecutive days. The script extracts absence streaks of three or more days and validates email addresses before generating a message to be sent to the parent.

## Features
- Detects absence streaks of 3 or more consecutive days for each student.
- Merges attendance data with student information.
- Validates email addresses for parent notification.
- Generates an automated message to parents regarding their child’s absence.

## Input
The code uses two Excel files:
1. **Attendance Data** (`Attendance_data.xlsx`): Contains daily attendance records for students.
   - Columns: `student_id`, `attendance_date`, `status` (`Present` or `Absent`).
   
2. **Student Data** (`Student_data.xlsx`): Contains information about the students and their parent’s contact details.
   - Columns: `student_id`, `student_name`, `parent_email`.

## Output
The script outputs a pandas DataFrame and generates a new Excel file `Updated_Absence_Report.xlsx`. The output contains the following columns:
- **student_id**: ID of the student.
- **absence_start_date**: Start date of the absence streak.
- **absence_end_date**: End date of the absence streak.
- **total_absent_days**: Total number of consecutive absent days.
- **parent_email**: Parent’s email address (validated).
- **msg**: Custom message to be sent to the parent regarding the student's absence.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- pandas
- re (regular expressions)
- openpyxl (for reading/writing Excel files)

To install the required dependencies, you can use:
```bash
pip install pandas openpyxl
```

## How to Use

1. **Prepare Your Data**:
   Ensure that you have two Excel files:
   - `Attendance_data.xlsx` (for attendance records)
   - `Student_data.xlsx` (for student information)

2. **Run the Script**:
   Call the `run()` function with your attendance and student data to generate the absence report. The output will be saved in an Excel file named `Updated_Absence_Report.xlsx`.

```python
# Load your datasets
attendance_df = pd.read_excel("path_to/Attendance_data.xlsx")
students_df = pd.read_excel("path_to/Student_data.xlsx")

# Run the process
result_df = run(attendance_df, students_df)

# Save the output to a new Excel file
result_df.to_excel("Updated_Absence_Report.xlsx", index=False)
```

3. **Output**:
   The output Excel file contains the final absence streak data, including a message for each valid email.

## Function Descriptions

### `find_absence_streaks(attendance_df)`
This function identifies streaks of absences for each student. It checks if a student has been absent for 3 or more consecutive days and returns the start and end dates of the absence period along with the total absent days.

### `validate_email(email)`
This function validates an email address using a regular expression pattern. It ensures that the parent email addresses are valid before attempting to send notifications.

### `join_and_validate_students(absence_df, students_df)`
This function merges the absence streaks with student information and validates the parent emails. It also creates a notification message to inform parents about their child's absences.

### `run(attendance_df, students_df)`
This is the main function that runs the entire process. It calls the other functions to find absence streaks, validate the emails, and generate the final DataFrame. The result is saved in an Excel file.

## Example

Here is an example of the final output:

| student_id | absence_start_date | absence_end_date | total_absent_days | parent_email            | msg                                                                                              |
